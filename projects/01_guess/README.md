# Guessing Game

## What?

Pinched from [here.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

## A side

So apparently you can create projects like this:

```bash
cargo new --name guess 01_guess
```

Where:

- `cargo new` creates a new project with a TOML file.
- `--name guess` flag allows you to name the project something different to your directory.
- `01_guess` is the name of the directory.

## `/src`
