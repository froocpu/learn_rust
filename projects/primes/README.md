# Primes

Silly prime number app with tests to get a feel of a real project.

## Build

```shell script
rustc src/main.rs
```

## Run tests

```shell script
cargo test
```

## Example usage

```shell script
./main 1556
# 1556 is not a prime.
```

### Improvements

- [ ] More optimisations (i.e. ends with an even number)
- [ ] Call to a pre-loaded file containing known primes.
- [ ] Benchmarking
